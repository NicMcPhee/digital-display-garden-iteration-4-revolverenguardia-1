This repository is a mirror of [Iteration 3 , Team  Revolver En Guardia](https://github.com/UMM-CSci-3601-S17/digital-display-garden-iteration-4-revolverenguardia-1)
which is a fork from [Iteration 2 , Team _Grimaldi_](https://github.com/UMM-CSci-3601-S17/digital-display-garden-iteration-2-grimaldi.git)
which is a fork from [Iteration 1 , Team _Claude Arabo_](https://github.com/UMM-CSci-3601-S17/digital-display-garden-iteration-1-claudearabo).
and substantially incorporates code from [Iteration 2 , Team _Oman Anwar_](https://github.com/UMM-CSci-3601-S17/digital-display-garden-iteration-2-omaranwar.git)


## Documentation  
We have an entire folder full of thorough documentation!
* [Deployment Instructions](/Documentation/DEPLOY.MD): Explains how to start up the project on digital ocean.  
* [Google-Charts](/Documentation/Google-Charts.md): Walks through how we implement Google Charts in Angular 2.  
* [ExcelParser](/Documentation/ExcelParser.md): Explains how the cloud-arabo and Grimaldi iterations parse excel spreadsheets. This wil be updated to reflect how Revolver En Guardia uses `ExcelParser.java`  
* [ExcelFileRequirements](/Documentation/ExcelFileRequirements.md): This will be updated soon to reflect some extra features that Revolver En Guardia have implemented.

## Setup

Cloning the project inside IntelliJ:

- When prompted to create a new IntelliJ project, select **yes**.
- Select **import project from existing model** and select **Gradle.**
- Make sure **Use default Gradle wrapper** is selected.
- Click **Finish.**

:fire: If IntelliJ ever prompts you to compile typescript files into
javascript **say no!**. Doing this will confuse webpack and break the client
side of your project during build. No permanent damage will be done, but it's
pretty annoying to deal with.

When you load the project on a new machine, tell Gradle to Refresh linked Gradle projects.

## Running your project
> Run the server  
> Run the client  

If you have data in the database from a previous version it would be
best to drop() the test database. In order to populate the database
* Run the Server and Client
* go to localhost:9000/admin (or whatever ip/port the client is running on)
* Import the data set from the Excel spreadsheet (.xlsx)
* the liveUploadId will be set to the latest data set imported
* liveUploadId determines which set of data to refer to within the database.

## Attempted and Completed Stories

#### Security

#### Picture Uploading

#### Improve Front-end &mdash; visitor's website :white_check_mark:
* Plant/Bed List Page
    * Provide drop-down menus for beds and common names, replacing the side bar
* Plant Page
    * Fix the size of the image and place it after the plant information
    * Add a bar that displays the number of likes and dislikes
* Both pages
    * Overhaul for the look of the entire website to make it look nicer

#### Flexible: Google Charts

#### Flexible: UMN logo (not chosen)
* Add UMN logo to the header of the website &mdash; incomplete

## Future work  
:soon: Google Charts: Some of the data Esther wants to see in our Google charts includes:  
1. Graphing time against the # of flower/bed page visits. This allows Steave and Esther to find the most popular time people are using the digital display garden and which beds are most popular.  
2. People's location in the Garden when they enter the digital garden.  
3. Making a map of where people walk through the garden.   
4. Top 20 plants that have the most comments, the top 20 plants that have the most likes, and the top 20 that have the most dislikes.  
5. A static function has been written in ExcelParser that deletes an uploadId, but there is no endpoint or client UI to make this happen.

:soon: Currently, all coordinates on the Map and the bubbleChart are hard coded. WCROC admin staff should have the ability to add new coordinate and bed to the Map and bubbleChart.   
:soon: An option for them to download the charts maybe useful to them in the future.


#### Finished by previous iteration groups
**Revolver En Guardia**
* Allow admin users to update the spreadsheet without losing previously obtained visitor data
* Export more metadata from plant information pages 
* Provide visual aids for visitor traffic data (i,e., Google charts) &mdash; partly
* Allow a visitor to choose plants by common name
* Provide social media links

**Grimaldi** :us: :notes: :mortar_board: ‚àÆ
* Leave comments about plants
* Allow a visitor to rate a plant
* Display counts of likes and dislikes on visitor website
* Display counts of comments on visitor website
* Generate QR Codes

**Oman Anwar** :gb: üèè
* Present plant data in a list
* Filter by bed number
* Display specific plant information
* Gather metadata from plant information pages; obtain likes, dislikes, page-views, and comments from plant pages, and store them on the server

**Claude Arabo** :fr: ü§∫ ü•à
* Import Excel Spreadsheet to Database

## Libraries used
### Client-Side
* **Angular 2**
* **Jasmine** and **Karma**

### Server-Side
* **Java**
* **Spark** is used for the server operations
* **JUnit** is used for testing
* **Apache** is used for importing and exporting data in .xlsx format
* **zxing** is used for generating QR codes (supports reading them if we want)
* **joda** is used for making an unique LiveUploadID
