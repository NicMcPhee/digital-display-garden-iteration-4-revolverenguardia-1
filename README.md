## Before you Start
Before starting this project you will need a couple of tools to help you prosper!
  * [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or other multi language IDE
  * The latest version of [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community)
  * A grasp of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/tutorial.html),
  [Angular-2](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/ ) and [Java's Apache Spark Platform](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/java/)
  

##  Introduction :hibiscus: :tulip: :cherry_blossom:

We were asked to build a web application for the West Central Research Outreach Center (WCROC) in Morris, MN. This web application was built to help communicate feedback from visitors visiting the garden located at WCROC to garden administrators. 
The web application was split into two parts the Visitor Interface and Administration Interface. 

## Key features:
### Visitor Interface:exclamation:
#### Filter Functionality :mag:
* Search by Bed and Search by Common Name

#### Flower Page includes the following :cherry_blossom:
* Default Garden Picture
* Common Name, Cultivar, and Bed location
* Feedback Functionality:
  * Like/Dislikes/Feedback progress bar
  * Comments
  * Comment count left on certain plant

#### Footer :heavy_check_mark:
* Links to the WCROC:
  * [Website](https://wcroc.cfans.umn.edu/public-gardens)
  * [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/HorticultureDisplayGarden)
  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/WCROCMorris)
  * [Youtube](https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCxU3Nsu5XjCy8XLfxHp1_Wg)

### Administration Interface:exclamation: 
#### Import :arrow_up:
* Gives functionality to import Accession List spreadsheet to populate website with plants.

#### Update :arrows_counterclockwise:
* Allows administrators to update the website without losing any past feedback data  

#### Export :arrow_down:
* Allows administrators to export collected feedback metadata from website into three different Excel sheets 
  * Comments: comments from visitors with timestamp of each comment
  * Plant Metadata:  likes, dislikes, comment count, and page views
  * Bed Metadata: page views and QR scan count
  
#### Qr Codes :calling:
* Ability to download QR Codes into a .zip file with a QR image for each garden location.

#### Google Charts  :bar_chart:
* Allows administrators to view garden statistics in Real time using google charts
  * Flower View Counts over Time
  * Combo Chart - Hour of the day vs. Views
  * HeatMap containing map of Garden with different metadata displayed for each bed
  * Top 20 Plants with Most Likes
  * Top 20 Plants with Most Dislikes
  * Top 20 Plants with Most Comments

  
#### Upload Images :camera:
* Allows administrators to upload an image for a certain flower 




## Documentation  
We have an entire folder full of thorough documentation!
* [Deployment Instructions](/Documentation/DEPLOY.MD): Explains how to start up the project on digital ocean.  
* [Google-Charts](/Documentation/Google-Charts.md): Walks through how we implement Google Charts in Angular 2.  
* [ExcelParser](/Documentation/ExcelParser.md): Explains how the cloud-arabo and Grimaldi iterations parse excel spreadsheets. This wil be updated to reflect how Revolver En Guardia uses `ExcelParser.java`  
* [ExcelFileRequirements](/Documentation/ExcelFileRequirements.md): This will be updated soon to reflect some extra features that Revolver En Guardia have implemented.

## Setup

Cloning the project inside IntelliJ:

- When prompted to create a new IntelliJ project, select **yes**.
- Select **import project from existing model** and select **Gradle.**
- Make sure **Use default Gradle wrapper** is selected.
- Click **Finish.**

:fire: If IntelliJ ever prompts you to compile typescript files into
javascript **say no!**. Doing this will confuse webpack and break the client
side of your project during build. No permanent damage will be done, but it's
pretty annoying to deal with.

When you load the project on a new machine, tell Gradle to Refresh linked Gradle projects.

## Running your project
> Run the server  
> Run the client  

If you have data in the database from a previous version it would be
best to drop() the test database. In order to populate the database
* Run the Server and Client
* go to localhost:9000/admin (or whatever ip/port the client is running on)
* Import the data set from the Excel spreadsheet (.xlsx)
* the liveUploadId will be set to the latest data set imported
* liveUploadId determines which set of data to refer to within the database.

## Future work  
:soon: Google Charts: Some of the data Esther wants to see in our Google charts includes:  
1. Graphing time against the # of flower/bed page visits. This allows Steave and Esther to find the most popular time people are using the digital display garden and which beds are most popular.  
2. People's location in the Garden when they enter the digital garden.  
3. Making a map of where people walk through the garden.   
4. Top 20 plants that have the most comments, the top 20 plants that have the most likes, and the top 20 that have the most dislikes.  
5. A static function has been written in ExcelParser that deletes an uploadId, but there is no endpoint or client UI to make this happen.

:soon: Currently, all coordinates on the Map and the bubbleChart are hard coded. WCROC admin staff should have the ability to add new coordinate and bed to the Map and bubbleChart.   
:soon: An option for them to download the charts maybe useful to them in the future.


#### Finished by previous iteration groups
