This pamphlet highlights some primary features of Digital Display Garden. Though it introduces `Export Collected Data` and `Goolge Charts` functionality, it mainly focuses on what kind of data users can expect from these features, and not necessarily on how to use them. Hence, if details about how to use the system are necessary, accompanying the pamphlet with the [Admin User Guide](/Documentation/UserGuide/DDGUserGuide-RevolverenGuardia.pdf) is recommended.
